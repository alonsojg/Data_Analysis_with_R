Intro:

This project evaluates a dataset from Prosper p2p lending platform. I acquired this dataset when working on the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. All credit goes to Prosper and Udacity.

The Idea behind this project is to identify many redflags that might lead one to believe to the existance of fraud in this loan data.

Summary:

	prosperLoanData.csv - original csv data file.

	index.html - this file was knitted using Rstudio displaying the entire analysis of the dataset.

	FinalProject.Rmd - contains all R code used in order to take this dataset apart and examining it.
